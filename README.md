# can-opener
it opens cans. no seriously it's a door opener kind of a thing. which I did for Microprocessor's lab project (I did it willingly and not at all by force [NOT!]).
it's actually a pretty good reference for learning C programming for Atmega 16/32 chips.It will get you more familiar with how to setup interrupts, handling keyboard input, Reading from and Writing data to EEPROM and all kinds of other stuff. :D
